static files are stored in ./src/assets directory

ex: assets
        images
            example.jpeg

<img src = " assets/images/example.jpeg"/>

the sort path works because : in angular.json has 
    "assets":["src/assets"]

for CSS and JS static file there is reference arrays available in angular.json

"styles":[],
"scripts":[]
