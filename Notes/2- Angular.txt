Angular Modules - ment to be containers that contains all the routes in the trees and identify the modules which can be loaded independently.

Modules are only loaded if the user access the part of that module in the site.

>If we make a service ,Directive ,component or pipe and register in the module .this will make those available in that perticular module except services ,
>If you want to use those in other modules register it there.
but services are provider registered in root injector so they are available accross angilar modules.
